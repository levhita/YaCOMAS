	  Yacomas 0.2_alpha released 
	* Variable Inicialization implemented in each file
	* Some logic bug's fixed
	  some files had logic erros with sessions, some others had errors with querys and incorrect use of columns
	  array variables fixed
	  A lot of files had incorrect assignment of variable names
	  We used $array[column] instead of $array['column']
	  This is why a lot of Notice warinings apeared. PHP get colum as a constant instead of variable 
	* Implementation of $_GET['variable'] instead of $variable in calls with parameters to files
	  Now we can use register_globals = Off  in php.ini file
