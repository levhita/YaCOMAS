Yacomas TODO:
--------------

1) Change the way that yacomas keep the control of events register to avoid events get mixed betwen hours, days and places.
   The problem is similar to asistants register to workshops We can re-use a similar code used in Ltalleres.php inside 
   of the asistants modules and drop the table evento_ocupa

* Implement e-mail messages to implement comunication between conferencist-admins & asistente-admin
* Program documentation
* Lot of optimizing 
* Lot of debugging 
* Lot of test
* Implement multi language support ( maybe with another tables?)
* User Documentation
* User Manual
* Make the programers document the code they have written 
* Maybe software reingeneering of some tables ?
* Anything else?
